# Assignment: application materials

In this assignment, you will update your resume, LinkedIn profile, and portfolio. 

If you need a refresher on how to create these, revisit the lessons from Industry Experience 1 preparatory course:

- [Crafting a winning resume](https://industry-experience.vercel.app/lessons/application-materials/resume.html)
- [Updating your LinkedIn Profile](https://industry-experience.vercel.app/lessons/application-materials/webprofiles.html)
- [Creating a portfolio](https://industry-experience.vercel.app/lessons/application-materials/portfolio.html)

## Requirements 

Your application materials must:
- Be up to date and include your latest skills and experiences, including your most recent industry experience
- Polished, and free of grammatical errors

## Submitting
Once you finish updates, you should:

- Submit links to your materials in Gradescope (ensure anyone at Kibo can view them)
- Upload a PDF version of your resume, LinkedIn profile and portfolio in Anchor
  - For LinkedIn and portfolio, download a PDF of the first page only. The purpose of this is not for evaluation, but to maintain a regulatory record of your work.
