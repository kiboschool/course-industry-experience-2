# Assignment: Apply for opportunities

For this assignment, you will apply to technical roles for your internship. You should start applying to relevant opportunities right away, and continue applying until you secure an internship. 

## Track your job applications
You are expected to track your applications. You can use any tracker you chose, though we recommend two below:

### Applimate
Applimate is an application that was built by Kibo's Google Student Developer Club to make tracking your job applications more efficient.

- **To start using applimate, go to: https://applimate.vercel.app/**

For more information about the app, you can reach out to Ayomide Onifade in Discord or via email.

### Google Sheet
You may also use a Google Sheet tracker. Make a [copy of the job application tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyblPl26CxdMDx8M8SxoEP-lcgHRGfTXvdGacnkIHMw/copy).

- Add your name to the title
- Add the positions you want to apply to as you find them
- Update the status of the opportunities as you apply and hear back

## Submit your tracker

- Submit a link to your job application tracker in Gradescope
- Upload a PDF of your tracker in Anchor

## Qualifying opportunities

Internships and roles can have different names: "Junior Developer" or "Quality Assurance Intern" might be roles that qualify, even though they aren't called "software developer intern". "IT Intern" might qualify or not, depending on the organization and the particular duties of the role.

To qualify for academic credit, your job or internship must:
- Use the technical skills you've learned in your coursework
  - Software development, data science, product management, UI design
- Be 250 hours of work or more
  - The work may be spread out over any number of weeks (e.g., 25 hours for 10 weeks or 40 hours for 8 weeks)
  - Your industry experience may be longer than the required minimum of 250 hours
- Occur between June and September of 2024
  - Ideally, you should start after June 14 2024 (when the Apr-2024 term ends) and finish by September 13, 2024 (when the Sep-2024 term ends). If your internship will finish later, that is fine. But you must submit the evaluations and report for academic credit by September 13 in order to receive credit.
- Have a mentor or supervisor who will give you feedback and evaluation

If the qualifications above are met, then the role can qualify for your industry experience. If you aren't sure if a particular position qualifies, ask in Discord or email the course instructors.

## Confirm your industry experience
Once you find an internship, you should: 

- Submit [this form](https://forms.gle/mHKsQyeZnKm7GfPV6) for approval </a>

_Once you accept an approved industry experience opportunity, you do not need to continue applying to additional positions._



## ðŸ¤” FAQs
- How many applications do you need to submit?
  - As many as it takes! You should continue applying for opportunities until you secure an approved industry experience
- Can I use my current job or internship as my industry experience?
  - Maybe. If your job or internship will occur from Jun - Sep 2024, and meets the requirements above, then you may be able to use it for credit. You should submit the form to get confirmation from course instructors. 
- How do I find an opportunity?
  - Revisit [Identifying Good Opportunities](https://industry-experience.vercel.app/lessons/applying/good-opportunities.html) and [Finding Opportunities](https://industry-experience.vercel.app/lessons/applying/finding-opportunities.html) from Industry Experience I.
