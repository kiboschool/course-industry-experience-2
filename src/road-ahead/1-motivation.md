# Career Coach: Meet Victor

> üí° Victor is a final year student studying computer science at the University of Lagos. 
  It‚Äôs three months to graduation, and Victor is focused on landing a full-time software developer role. His search is not going as well as he hoped, so he makes an appointment with Fatima, a career counselor, to talk through his experience. 
  Read the conversation below between Victor and Fatima. 

**Fatima:** Hello Victor, it's great to see you. What brings you to the career office today?

**Victor:** Hello Fatima, thanks for meeting with me. To be honest with you, I‚Äôm very very frustrated right now. I've been applying to so many software developer jobs, over 200 actually, and I haven't gotten any interviews. I'm graduating in three months, and I'm starting to panic. My family has spent so much money on this degree. I don‚Äôt want to graduate and be back home sitting around doing nothing. 

**Fatima:** It sounds like you‚Äôve put a lot of effort into your job search. I can imagine how frustrating it must be not to get the results you want and how it might be causing you some stress. I‚Äôd like to better understand your job search process. Can you share more about how you approach your applications?

**Victor:** Well, I made a resume and cover letter last month. I had someone review it, and they said it was good. So a few days a week, I search on LinkedIn, Jobberman, and Tech Cabal, and I drop my resume and cover letter to all the software development roles. I don‚Äôt really understand why I‚Äôm not getting interviews. I followed the resume template your office provided. Are you sure it was a good template? Because I don‚Äôt see how it could be if students like me aren‚Äôt getting jobs. 

**Fatima:** I understand that you may have concerns about the resume template. Before we discuss that, can you walk me through your decision-making process when it comes to applying for jobs? How do you decide which positions to target?

**Victor:** I basically apply to any software development job I come across, whether it's in healthcare, finance, or tech. I‚Äôm really trying to increase my chances of finding something. I can‚Äôt be too picky. 

**Fatima:** I see. That's a broad approach. How do you decide which locations to apply to? 

**Victor:** I've been applying everywhere. I figure I can move for the right opportunity.

**Fatima:** Being open to relocation is good, but you may want to focus on remote roles or locations where you can realistically move. Some employers may not be able to support relocation. 

**Victor:** Well, if there aren‚Äôt jobs here and I want a job, what other option do I have? You guys told us to spend time applying, and so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm just following instructions here. If the companies won‚Äôt give me a chance, maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with what the career service is advising or the companies process themselves. I‚Äôm really doing everything I can here.

**Fatima:** I understand you are trying. How do you go about matching your skills and experiences with a given job? Are you making your application align with what the employer is looking for? 

**Victor:** Honestly, I haven't been doing that much. I just figure they'll see my experience and know I'm a good fit. My skills will speak for themself. 

**Fatima**: I see. Tell me, for most of the applications, how have you felt about your qualifications? Do you believe you‚Äôve been a good fit?

**Victor:** If I‚Äôm being honest, almost all the jobs want you to have 2 years or more of experience, even the junior developer ones. So I‚Äôve just applied to everything that‚Äôs junior or mid-level. I haven‚Äôt had the experience, but I built some cool projects for my portfolio. So I‚Äôm shooting my shot. I can do great in an interview and show someone it‚Äôs worth taking a chance on me.
