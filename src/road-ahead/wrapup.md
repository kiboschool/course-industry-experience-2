## What We’ve Learned

This unit was an introduction to career development and knowing yourself. In the unit, we learned:

- Career development is a lifelong cycle which requires adaptability, experimentation, and building a strong network
- Careers are non-linear. Instead of a series of well-defined steps on a ladder, most career journeys will resemble climbing a rock wall and require agility
- You are the owner of your career. Successful career engineering requires taking an ownership mindset and focusing on one’s individual actions, even in the midst of challenging circumstances
- Career development starts with knowing yourself, and having a realistic sense of your strengths, weaknesses and purpose
