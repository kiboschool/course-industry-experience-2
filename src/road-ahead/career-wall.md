# The Rocky Road Ahead

As you may have experienced when applying for roles in the past, getting an entry-level job can be tough. Many entry-level jobs require experience and so early job seekers feel like they are caught in a bind: without being given an opportunity to start, how does one gain experience? Situations like this can leave job seekers feeling frustrated and at the mercy of an impossible system. 


> 🤔 So, what’s an entry-level job seeker to do?

One approach to navigating modern career development is to think like an engineer. Whether they are designing new buildings, electrical circuits, or software systems, engineers focus on solving problems. They use their technical knowledge, collaboration skills, and creativity to find solutions to complex problems. Navigating a career is a complex problem, that calls for “career engineering.”

## Extreme Ownership

Becoming an effective career engineer requires taking an analytical and proactive approach to career development. While academic institutions, mentors, or others may provide support, **you and you alone are responsible for your success.**
