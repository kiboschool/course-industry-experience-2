# Connections Matter

<aside>
  üó£ When I talk to first-gen college students about networking and their job search, they often bristle at the idea of elevating who-you-know over what-you-know. Careers require a both/and approach. Build your knowledge and your skills -- but never doubt that your network amplifies your qualifications. It's more than a shortcut: it's your social capital.
  <br />- Ann Kirshner, President of Hunter College

Networking is an important, yet often misunderstood, aspect of career development. In this lesson, we‚Äôll discuss why and how to build a professional network for the long-term. 

> ü§î What do you imagine when you hear the word ‚Äúnetworking?‚Äù How does the thought of networking make you feel?

Many people have a negative association with networking. Personally, my networking nightmare is being in a room full of strangers, awkwardly trying to figure out how to insert myself into a conversation. Or, after chatting with someone for a few minutes, figuring out just how to end the conversation while secretly wishing I were home watching YouTube. Networking can be a challenge! But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. 

Even though many experience networking was uncomfortable or slimy, there is a way to network authentically and joyfully, even if you are an introvert! We need to reframe our understanding of networking.  Networking is not about attending fancy events, chatting up strangers, or being the life of the party.  Networking is about building **genuine** connections. 

## Reframing Networking

As the video explains, it is not about ‚Äúdoing networking‚Äù but instead becoming part of a network. Many of us find networking uncomfortable because we view it as a bit exploitative, like manipulating or being manipulated for another person‚Äôs purpose. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way!

As noted in the video, people are often happy to do small things to help others, especially when it benefits the larger network or community. 

## Why Connections Matter

People are willing to invest in creating stronger networks or communities. Rather than a transaction exchange of favors, networking is about building genuine connections. Connecting is at the heart of what makes us human. 

Human beings have an innate desire for relationships and connections. Various studies in psychology and sociology have shown that connecting to others is vital for well-being and growth. One example is the [**Harvard Study of Adult Development**](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/), which began in the 1930s and is one of the longest-running studies of adult life. The study finds that, more than wealth or fame, the most important thing that keeps people happy throughout their lives is close relationships. 

### Discuss: Being Genuine

<aside>
‚ùì We‚Äôve referred a few times to the idea of ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù connections. What do you believe makes a connection genuine? What is the opposite of a genuine relationship?

A genuine connection is one that derives from real interest in building a lasting relationship. A genuine connection is not:

- Transactional, and designed to only help you get what you want
- Shallow, and lacking in intellectual or emotional depth
- Fake, and showing an overly polished or overly-contrived facade

Instead, genuine connections require building relationships that extend beyond immediate needs. These connections contribute to a sense of belonging, shared purpose, and success.

## Why Professional Networking Matters

Connections to other people matter for our well-being. But what role do professional networks play, and what makes genuine professional networks vital? 

- **Enhanced job opportunities:** job market competition is fierce and referrals can be key to learning about or obtaining an interview for a job.  According to CNBC, 70% of all jobs are not published publically on job sites. In my experience at Google, given the high number of job applications, one of the most critical ways to stand out was through a referral from an existing employee. This would often get your application flagged for a recruiter to review, and avoid the fate of 99% of application materials which are automatically rejected by an automated system
- **Increased credibility:** your network can be a strong signal of your credibility in an industry. If you are connected to experts or relevant professionals, you are more likely to be perceived as credible, especially if those professionals are willing to recommend or vouch for you
- **Guidance and mentorship:** a strong network can provide access to peers and  experienced professionals who can give you advice, encouragement, and support.
- **Development of human skills:** learning to build and maintain relationships is a necessary skill for career success. Building your network is an opportunity to practice communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills that are sought after by employers and useful in the workplace.

Overall, just as genuine connection leads to emotional well-being, having strong professional connections contributes to job satisfaction.
