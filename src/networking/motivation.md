**Subject:** Seeking Guidance and Mentorship to Transform Healthcare in Rural Kenya

Dear Ms. Karabangi,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is Nia Mwangi, a final-year student at Moi University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a passion for leveraging technology to address healthcare challenges in underserved communities. As I approach the threshold of my academic journey, I am reaching out to you with a deep-seated desire to learn, grow, and contribute to the transformative landscape of healthcare.

My interest in healthcare comes from my family. My mother is a dedicated nurse who has spent her career serving communities in need. I see how challenging her work is, and I believe there is a lot more that can be done to help healthcare providers like her. 

Your company has stood out to me as a beacon of innovation and commitment to improving health outcomes. Your team's dedication to creating software solutions that bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare resonates deeply with my aspirations. I believe that under the guidance of a seasoned mentor like you, I can contribute significantly to your mission while gaining invaluable insights and skills to shape my own journey.

My academic background in Computer Science, combined with hands-on experiences in community health outreach programs, has equipped me with a solid foundation. However, I am eager to delve deeper into the world of software development and its applications in healthcare. I am a fast learner, adaptable, and possess a keen understanding of the unique challenges faced by rural communities in Kenya.

What sets me apart is not just my technical skills, but the genuine passion that fuels my desire to make a lasting impact. Growing up in a household where healthcare challenges were a daily topic of discussion has given me a unique perspective‚Äîone that understands the complexities and nuances of providing healthcare in resource-constrained environments.

I am confident that I can channel this passion into innovative solutions that will positively affect the lives of those who need it most.

I would be honored to have the CEO of a notable company like you as my mentor.  A mentorship under your guidance would not only be a tremendous privilege but a pivotal moment in my journey toward making a meaningful impact in healthcare.

Thank you for considering my request. I eagerly anticipate speaking with you, beginning this mentorship journey, and contributing to the positive change we can bring to healthcare.

Warm regards,

Nia Mwangi<br />
