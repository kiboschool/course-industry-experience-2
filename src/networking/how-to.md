# How to Network Naturally

In this lesson, we’ll discuss tactical tips for cultivating your network as a university student or early career professional. 

As previously stated, the goal of making connections is not to “do networking,” but become part of a network. As you build your professional connections, you are not looking to create one network but rather become part of many diverse networks. But how do you choose who to connect with? The answer lies in understanding the power of both **strong ties** and **weak ties.**

## Why strong and weak ties matter

Imagine your professional network as a sturdy bridge, connecting you to opportunities. To reach your destination, you need both the strong pillars of close connections and the flexible cables of more distant ties. 

**Strong ties** are your close connections – colleagues you work with daily, classmates you study with, family members, or mentors with whom you’ve had a long relationship. With your strong ties, you have a long history, trust, and deep understanding. 

**Weak ties** are your casual acquaintances — the classmate you met once during an event, someone you met a conference, or a friend of a friend. With your weak ties, you have some familiarity, but the connection might be less frequent or deep. 

Strong ties are the emotional bedrock of your network; they offer much needed support, stability, and insider knowledge within your field. It’s vital to have strong ties with whom you can share openly and honestly. 

But strong ties are not enough! Weak ties serve an important purpose too. Research by Mark Granovetter in 1973 and a recent [2022 study by MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2022/weak-ties-linkedin-employment-0915) using LinkedIn data describe the “paradox of weak ties,” which is the idea that weak ties are *better* for finding new  job opportunities. That’s because the people you are closest to are more likely to have networks that most resemble your own, and may not add much new information. Casual acquaintances are more likely to have greater reach to people and informational outside of your own networks. Building a diverse network takes time and effort, and requires tapping into both the strength of close connections and the bridge-building potential of weak ties.

 

## Start Where You Are: Building Peer Networks

One misconception about building a network is that a strong network requires having a lot of “important” contacts or that connections with experienced professionals are the most valuable. This could not be further from the truth! Your peers are among the most important connections you will have. Many notable companies, from Google and Facebook to Snapchat, Paystack, and PiggyVest, were founded by people who met during university. 

So, investing in cultivating strong peer relationships at school and work is paramount. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, of all relationships in university, the ones with peers are likely to be the most significant. Peers provide more than long-term career support. They can be immediate partners in working through emotional periods, studying, and navigating university. 

### Better Together

> 🤲🏿 One of Kibo's core values is **#BetterTogether.**  Being better together expands beyond your time at Kibo. As you develop your career, your university classmates and fellow alumni will be among your strongest advocates. That's why some of the most well-known universities in the world (Stanford, Harvard, etc.) are so powerful. As their alumni head into the world and make impact, they serve as advocates for their brand, encouraging employers and influencers to offer opportunities to those at or coming from their institution. Over time, this virtuous cycle makes their degrees and networks even more durable and valuable. 

### Reflect: Your Relationships at Kibo

> ❓ Consider your relationships at Kibo. How have you cultivated or expanded your peer network?
>
> - Can you name a peer you admire? What are the qualities you respect?
> - Do you have diverse friendships, i.e., with people from a different geography, gender, cohorts or different interests?
> - Have you maintained relationships, e.g., if you worked well with someone in a prior term or project, have you checked in with them recently?
> - How could you extend relationships beyond required classwork (e.g., form study groups, set up a class group WhatsApp, attend a networking event together)?


## Go Online: Tips for Cultivating a Network on LinkedIn

One way to build your weak ties is via online networking sites, e.g., Github, LinkedIn, X (formerly known as Twitter), and more. Thoughtful engagement on these websites can help you build a diverse network that goes beyond those you know well.

## Go Outside: How to Succeed at Networking Events

We previously discussed how to build your network online. While building a network online is important, it is not sufficient! In an era where online connections come cheaply, in-person networking still offers many benefits including:

- Memorability: Putting "a face to the name" matters. We are more likely to remember people and experiences we have in-person. An in-person meeting can be a great primer to a relationship that continues online, or a way to strengthen a relationship that begins online.
- Attention: most posts online are missed or ignored. When you speak to someone in person, they can respond 'in real time' and you greatly increase your chances of being heard and understood.
- Chemistry: human relationships involve an intangible element. Sometimes people just click! While it's sometimes possible to have this spark online, it is much more likely in-person.  

>  💡 In-person networking still matters in a digital age!

Networking events are some of the most fraught part of networking, and a big reason that many people hate networking. Whether you are introverted or extroverted, speaking with strangers can be a source of apprehension.
