# Work experience self-evaluations

As you complete your work experience, you will fill out periodic self-evaluations.

In these evaluations, you will reflect on what you are doing well, what you are doing poorly, what you are learning, what is blocking your progress, and where you plan to improve.

Your grade for the self-evaluations depends on your timely completion and honest reflection, not on how well you are doing in your work experience (that's covered by your supervisor evaluation).
