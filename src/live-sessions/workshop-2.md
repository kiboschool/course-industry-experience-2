# Workshop 2

Industry Experience workshops help you develop professional skills. Workshops focus on technical or soft skills, and are led by an industry expert.

In order to receive credit for the workshop, you must attend on Zoom and submit evidence of your participation, such as a screenshot or note reflecting on what you learned from the experience.
