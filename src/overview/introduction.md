## **Course Description**

Industry Experience is a form of experiential learning that will let you apply your academic knowledge in a professional context. You will work to build software that meets the needs of a professional organization by completing either:

- An approved internship
- A product studio or open-source project

During your industry experience, you will work on tasks that meet the needs of your sponsoring organization. Whether you undertake an internship, product studio or open-source collaboration, your industry experience must include significant, substantial computer science.

In addition to building your project, you will submit bi-weekly written reflections on your personal goals, challenges, and team feedback. At the end of the term, you must obtain written feedback from you organization supervisor. You will also submit a final report which describes the problem statement, approaches/methods used, deliverables, and skills you gained. Industry Experience culminates in a final presentation which is shared as a public blog post.

By the end of the course, you will:

- Craft an effective professional presence including resume, portfolio and online website
